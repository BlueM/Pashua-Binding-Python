"""
Pashua.py - Interface to Pashua

Pashua is an application that can be used to provide some type of dialog GUI
for Python and shell applications on Mac OS X. Pashua.py is the glue between
your script and Pashua. To learn more about Pashua, take a look at the
application's Readme file. Pashua's homepage is www.bluem.net/jump/pashua
Please note in order for the example to work, the Pashua application
must be in the current path, in /Applications/ or in ~/Applications/
If none of these paths apply, you will have to specify it manually:
Pashua.PATH = '/path/to/appfolder';
... before you call Pashua.run(). Alternatively, you may specify the
path (the directory that contains Pashua.app, without trailing slash)
as 3rd argument to run().
