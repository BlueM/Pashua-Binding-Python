Overview
===========

This is a Python language binding (glue code) for using [Pashua](http://www.bluem.net/jump/pashua) from Python. Pashua is a Mac OS X application for using native GUI dialog windows in various programming languages.

The repository contains two files: `Pashua.py`, a Python module which handles the communication with Pashua, and `example.py`, a simple script wich uses `Pashua.py` to display a dialog. The way the module works is neither the best nor the only way to “talk” to Pashua from within Python, but rather one out of several possibe implementations.


Requirements
=============
This code requires Python 2 and Pashua. The Python executables shipped by Apple as part of the last few releases of Mac OS X can be used to run the code.
